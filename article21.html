              <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n East Asia there exists a country with a population of 1.4 billion. It's the third-largest country in the world. The country is called China. China is also known as the name of "The World of the Factory". It's the world's largest producer of toys, clothes, etc. The complete region of China is 9.597 million kmÂ².</p>
              
              <h2>The Great Wall of China</h2>
              <p>An ancient wall which is in China is made of cement, bricks, stones, mud, etc. It's about
                196 kilometers long, 9.1 meters wide, and 15 meters high. It was meant to guard the north of China from opponent attacks and was produced in 1878. The lengthy building was made up of humans. The first section of the wall is made of compressed stone and soil. In the empire of the Ming Dynasty, the wall was made of bricks. There are 7,000 keeper halls, block houses for fighters, and beacons to transmit steam signals.
                
                There's been a rumor that people who have gone into space, said that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space because of its big presence; but this isn't real. Since the wall looks a lot like the stone and soil that encircle it, it's delicate to see with the natural eye, indeed from low Earth orbit, and it's difficult for making orbital pics.
                </p>
