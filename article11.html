              <!-- <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he story of Hades and Persephone is one riddled with deceit, abduction, and love. It is one of the most well-known and controversial stories from Greek mythology. Over the years, there have been a handful of different variations and retellings of this story.</p> -->
              <h2>1. Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta Splendens):</h2>
              <P>The Siamese fighting fish (Betta Splendens), or Betta, is a freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia, specifically Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Betta fish are among the world's most popular and beautiful pet fish. While the genus Betta contains 73 species, only Betta Splendens are eponymously known as "bettas," owing to their global popularity as a pet: they are among the most widely available aquarium fish in the world, owing to their varied and vibrant color. Betta fish are native to Asia, where they live in swamps, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Male bettas are the devoted fathers who use their mouths to create bubble nests for their young and fiercely defend them from prey. Betta fish, like us, are diurnal. That's why they are active during the day and sleep at night, necessitating the use of darkness to get a good night's rest. While some bettas are captured in the wild, the vast majority of those sold in the United States come from breeding farms in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, where they are commonly kept in small bottles. Fish are haphazardly dumped into baskets covered with nets and scooped up into small plastic cups for transport to the United States.</P>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/siamese.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <!-- <figcaption>Lorem idpsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>Betta fish can be frustrated and depressed. While most of them can be content in a tank on their own, their environment still requires a lot of enrichment, such as caves, plants, and space to explore. They are also stressed, especially when their fins are picked at by other incompatible fish in the same tank. Female bettas may be able to live in a peaceful group if they have enough space and hiding places. While males will fight other males and male gouramis (a similar-looking species), they may be able to live alone in a "community" aquarium with other docile fish species such as Cory catfish, and kuhli loaches, or guppies. They can coexist with nonfish species such as snails, ghost shrimp, and frogs. If aggression becomes a problem in any community tank, keep and maintain a separate, working quarantine aquarium where individuals can be placed to avoid conflict with other fish. Bettas are known to recognize humans, will follow your finger around the aquarium, and can even be trained to perform tricks! Betta fish have a life span of 3 to 5 years on average, but in rare cases, they can live up to 8 or 9 years in captivity. Bettas have a variety of tail shapes, the most common of which is the "veil tail." The "half-moon," "double tail," "short-finned fighting-style tail," and "crown tail" are other tail shapes.</p> 
              
              <h2>2. ClownFish:</h2>
              <p>The clownfish, best known for its appearances in the films "Finding Nemo" and "Finding Dory," has become a popular aquarium pet. Nemo and his father, Marlin, are ocellaris clownfish, also known as clown anemonefish or false clownfish. Anemonefish get their name from the sea urchins that they live in. There are 28 anemonefish species, and they come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, yellow, black, brown, and multi-colored stripes. The fish's bright color, combined with those stunning, thick white bands, makes it one of the most easily recognized fish. The majority of false clownfish are orange in color with three white bands on the head and body. The white bands are black-outlined. According to the Animal Diversity Web, their bodies are slightly longer than 3 inches (88 millimeters) on average, but they can grow up to 4 inches (110 mm) (ADW). The tail is rounded, and the dorsal fin has 11 spines. Before taking up residence, clownfish perform an elaborate dance with an anemone, gently touching its tentacles with various parts of their bodies until they are adjusted to their host. A layer of mucus on the clownfish's skin protects it from the lethal sting of the fish-eating anemone. In exchange for protection from predators and food scraps, the clownfish chases away intruders and parasites by preening on its host.</p>

                <!-- <figcaption>The Fate of Persephone by Walter Crane </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>They can change gender, but will only do so to become the dominant female in a group. The transformation is irreversible. Clownfish are found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where they live in the warm waters of sheltered reefs and shallow seas. To stay warm during the winter, they will migrate to deeper water. Clownfish are omnivorous creatures. They feed on dead anemone tentacles, anemone leftovers, plankton, mollusks, zooplankton, phytoplankton, small crustaceans, and various algae. Male clownfish are devoted. They will clean the nest, guard the eggs, and prepare the nest for the female. Clownfish communicate by popping and clicking their fins. Clownfish feed by swimming onto the reef, attracting larger fish, and luring them back to the anemone. The larger fish will be stung and eaten by the anemone, leaving the remains for the clownfish.</p>
              <h2>3. Threadfin Butterflyfish:</h2>
              <p>This Butterflyfish is a popular centerpiece in many home aquariums, and it has a wonderfully bold personality to match its vibrant colors.
                It can grow to be 9 inches long and has a calm demeanor, making it one of the most photographed underwater fish. Their body is pearly white, which fades to a bright yellow color near the tail end and up to the dorsal fins. There are also diagonal black perpendicular lines that form a chevron-like pattern. These fish require large tanks (at least 100 gallons) and adapt well to aquarium life, making them an excellent choice for newcomers. Threadfin butterflyfish (Chaetodon Auriga) are also known as Auriga butterflyfish, Threadfin coralfish, Cross-stripe butterflyfish, and Whip butterflyfish. Their common name is derived from the filament that hangs off the back of an adult fish's dorsal fin. The filament is formed by fusing the soft dorsal fin's fifth and sixth filaments into a thread. As the fish ages, the thread becomes longer.
                </p>
              <p>They are members of the large subgenus Rabdophorus, which some experts believe should be recognized as a separate genus. This subgenus is distinguished by two areas of ascending and descending oblique lines. Threadfin butterflyfish in the Red Sea is known as Chaetodon Auriga because they lack the eyespot on the back of their dorsal fin. A dark spot is visible on the back of the soft dorsal fin, and a black bar runs through the eye. Between the eyes, a series of thin yellow lines run across the face. They have a pointed snout and narrow, sharp teeth. It is impossible to classify them based on their appearance. The dorsal fin is edged with a fine blue line, and the caudal fin is lined with brown. Threadfin butterflyfish are frequently seen in pairs and, like all butterflyfish, are difficult to approach closely. Although they swim in the open, they always have a hole nearby and are quick to enter it. If they suspect you are following them, they will flee. They are found from Mossel Bay in South Africa up the African coast to the Red Sea, and across the Indo Pacific to Japan in the north and Lord Howe Island in the south of Australia.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">

                <!-- <figcaption>The Fate of Persephone by Walter Crane </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>Threadfin butterflyfish can withstand much lower temperatures than other butterflyfish. Threadfin butterflyfish are omnivores that eat everything from hard and soft corals to worms, sponges, microalgae, and plankton. They forage on the reef's sides and tops, often in groups with members of their species and other butterflyfish species. The threadfin butterflyfish is a very easy fish to keep in an aquarium because of its ability to survive in higher temperature ranges and have a more varied diet than other butterflyfish. It's a brightly colored fish that's probably good for beginners. They are also extremely disease resistant, which is a bonus. They are not, however, reef safe, and it is best to keep only one in a tank unless it is a mated pair. Due to their territorial nature, they will attack other members of their species who they perceive as a threat to their food source. They will accept the most prepared foods with open arms. Because they prefer swimming in the open, a tank should include hiding places and overhangs and be fairly large.</p>
              <h2>4. Regal Angelfish:</h2>
              <p>All Angelfish has a lovely, elegant appearance, but the regal angelfish is one of the loveliest. It is also one of the most challenging to keep in an aquarium. They can grow to be around 10 inches long, requiring a large tank (a minimum of 100 gallons with plenty of hiding spots). The royal angelfish is a small to medium-sized aquatic fish with a streamlined body, two lateral fins, and a caudal fin. Pygoplites Diacanthus, or regal angelfish, is a brightly colored fish with alternate yellow, orange, blue, or white stripes, a black outline, and a pouty mouth. This species of fish can be found in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Indo Pacific Ocean. This fish has a stable population and is seen breeding in large numbers throughout its natural habitat, which includes the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Indo Pacific Ocean. The exact number of this fish species' breeding population is unknown. Because of the presence of alternate colored bands on its body, this fish species is also known as empress angelfish, royal empress angelfish, and banded angelfish. It forages among the coral reefs and sponges that feed on them and hides from predators in underwater caves. In domesticated environments, they are also kept in captivity in aquariums and fish tanks. The majority of these aggressive marine creatures have been observed living alone, but they have also been observed in pairs. These marine animals are also seen moving in small groups of two or more females and one male regal angelfish between natural coral reefs. They are also kept in aquariums with other docile fishes and are seen as very social specimens.</p>
              
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/fish4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <!-- <figcaption>The Fate of Persephone by Walter Crane </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>These fish are typically preyed upon by larger aquatic fishes and mollusks. They may have a life span of around 10 years or less in the wild, but in captivity, with good conditions, they have been observed to have a generally longer life. In aquariums, the longest recorded lifespan for a regal angelfish is around 15 years if the tank size is correct. These fish have a spiny exoskeleton and a bony endoskeleton. A pair of swimming fins on the wither side of their body, a streamlined body, and a caudal fin for swift movement through water are a few general characteristics. The coloring of juveniles is the same as that of adults. Regals are extremely cute and appear to be pouting. They are docile, social, and appear to be very friendly in a well-kept environment. The alternate banding patterns on the bodies of these marine animals are a major draw. These fishes aren't particularly vocal, but they do have their way of communicating. Regal may talk via vibrations produced in the waterbody and also respond to bioluminescence and electrical impulses produced in the body. Angelfish have a well-developed nervous system that allows them to properly use their senses. Male and female regal angelfish do not have distinct names and are referred to interchangeably. A male and female angelfish differ in that the females have a more rounded body and are smaller in size than the males. The exotic coloration of their exoskeleton, as well as the beautiful banding pattern, are all reasons to keep them as pets. They live for a longer period in a well-kept aquarium where they are well-fed, making them excellent pets.</p>
              <h2>5. Moorish Idol:</h2>
              <p>The Moorish Idol is the coral reef's pin-up poster fish.
                They appear in nearly every underwater photographer's portfolio, diving pamphlet, and pet store painting.
                This beautiful fish is native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean's coral reefs, and it has large thick vertical stripes in contrasting black and white. In addition, they have a sunlight yellow patch on the back of their body. They have long snouts and a bright yellowy/orange mask that runs across them. Moorish Idols have a long extravagant filament that extends from the dorsal fin tip.
                Interestingly, they resemble Butterflyfish, but despite sharing similar feeding habits, they are not in the same family. They can grow to be 9 inches long and are extremely difficult to keep in captivity due to the diet and tank size requirements. This is a fish species that is quite fascinating to learn about. They are shy fish that prefers to avoid contact with other fish. They have black, white, and yellow bars on their bodies. These fish have a vast population distribution that stretches across the Pacific Ocean. They can be found in the eastern and Indo-Pacific oceans' tropical reefs. The diet of Moorish idols consists of algae and small invertebrates, and they eat two to three times per day. Marine pollution is endangering their reef habitat. One of these fish's adaptations is that they have distinct color patterns that often confuse their predators and are used to protect themselves. Because they can only survive in salt water, it is difficult to replicate their reef habitat in an aquarium. It is preferable to release this fish into the wild rather than keeping it in an aquarium because it has a better chance of survival. Moorish idols are known to be shallow-water fishes that live mostly on flat reefs. The answer to the question 'is a Moorish idol reef safe?' is yes. In general, Moorish idols can be found at depths ranging from 1 to 590 feet (0.3-180 m).

              </figure>
              <p>Zanclus cornutus is a peaceful fish that can coexist with other fish and larger invertebrates. They are frequently seen in pairs or large groups of their species. When they are kept in captivity, they can become aggressive towards other fish if their territory is threatened. This, in turn, makes them vulnerable to stress, which is harmful to the fish. Their lifespan in captivity is also reduced as a result of this. The lifespan of a Moorish idol in the wild is two to four years, and one year in captivity. Moorish idols are thought to be small fish with disk-like bodies. They are extremely shy fish that cannot eat in front of other fish. They have bristly teeth and a long tubular month. These fish are small and have a unique color distribution on their bodies, which makes them so adorable. These species' males are known to be aggressive toward one another if they believe their territory is being threatened. They are docile to other fish species and can coexist with them, but they have a limited lifespan in captivity. They can only last a year. A juvenile Moorish idol is a baby Moorish idol. Algae, brine shrimps, and other small invertebrates make up the diet of the Moorish idol. They prefer to live along tropical reefs and can be seen feeding on corals and sponges. These fish make wonderful pets, but they require a lot of attention when kept in an aquarium. The aquarium must be cleaned, and the water must be saltwater only. Other corals on the aquarium's surface must be included because these fish feed on them. In captivity, they are unable to reproduce. Their feeding habits are difficult to replicate even though they live in different parts of the ocean. They are also extremely shy and are unable to adjust with their other tank mates if there is insufficient space in the tank. In captivity, a Moorish idol has a one-year lifespan because it becomes susceptible to diseases and suffers from stress. When the tank's water level is low, they become aggressive. As a result, it is critical to maintaining a healthy water level in which the fish can swim freely.</p>
