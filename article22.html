              <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>ustralia is a country with the Australian continent, Tasmania, and smaller islands. With an area of 7,617,930 square kilometers, Australia is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest country. It has a lot of landscapes and climates, including deserts, tropical rainforests, and mountain ranges. Indigenous Australians have lived on the continent for about 65,000 years. The first European explorers arrived in the early 17th century. In 1770, Great Britain claimed Australia's eastern half and started settlement. Australia's national day was January 26, 1788, when the first settlers arrived. The population grew steadily and by the 1850s, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers. There were also five self-governing crown colonies. On January 1, 1901, the six colonies federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia. Since then, Australia has kept a stable government and a wealthy economy. Australia is a country made up of six states and ten territories. Its population is nearly 26 million. Most people live in cities on the east coast. The capital is Canberra. The five biggest cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Australia has been shaped by centuries of immigration. Immigrants make up 30% of the population. Almost half of Australians have at least one parent born overseas. Australia's economy comes from various sources, including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture, and international education. Its natural resources and international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy. Australia is a developed country with a strong economy. It has the world's thirteenth-largest economy, tenth-highest per capita income, and eighth-highest Human Development Index.</p>
              <p>Australia is a regional power and spends a lot on its military. In global surveys, Australia ranks highly for quality of life, democracy, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties, safety, and political rights. All of its major cities do well in these surveys. Australia is a member of international groupings including the United Nations, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, ANZUS, AUKUS, Five Eyes, the Quad, APEC, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community, and the Commonwealth of Nations. Australia's name comes from Latin for "southern land", Terra Australis. Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, and Terra Australis was the name they used for the new territories. In the early 19th century, Australia was best known as New Holland. That was the name Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer, used in 1644. The name Australia was popularized by Matthew Flinders, an explorer who said it sounded better than Terra Australis. Several famous early cartographers also used the word Australia on their maps.</p>
              <h2>Sydney Opera House:</h2>
              <p>The Sydney Opera House is a world-famous building and a 20th century architecture masterpiece. It's a performing arts center located on Sydney Harbor. Designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The NSW government, led by Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958, with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation. The building and grounds take up the whole of Bennelong Point. It's on Sydney Harbor between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove. The building is near Sydney's central business district, the Royal Botanic Gardens, and the Sydney Harbor Bridge. The building has multiple performance venues. They host more than 1,500 performances every year. Over 1 million people go to these performances. They're put on by many different performing artists. This includes Opera Australia, the Sydney Theater Company, and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. The Sydney Opera House is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia. More than 8 million people visit it every year. About 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year. It's managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust. This is an agency of the New South Wales State Government. The Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 28 June 2007. It had been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005. The Opera House was also a finalist on the New 7 Wonders of the World campaign list. The facility features a modern expressionist design. It has a series of large precast concrete "shells". These shells make up the roofs of the building. The building covers 1.8 hectares of land. It's 183 m (600 ft) by 120 m (394 ft). The building is supported on 588 concrete piers. The highest roof point is 67 meters above sea-level.</p>
              <p>The roof is made of 2,194 precast concrete sections. These sections weigh up to 15 tons each. The "shells" on the roof are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs. They look uniformly white from a distance, but they have a subtle chevron pattern made of 1,056,006 tiles in two colors: glossy white, and matte cream. The tiles were made by the Swedish company Höganäs AB, which usually produces stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry. Most of the exterior is made of pink granite from Tarana, with some concrete, wood from Australian white birch, and brush box ghulam. The Concert Hall is in the western group of shells and the Joan Sutherland Theater is in the eastern group. The shells are different sizes to reflect the different heights needed inside. The Drama Theater, the Playhouse and the Studio are all within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by open public spaces. The forecourt with the steps is a performance space. The building includes a recording studio, retail shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars. Guided tours are available of the front-of-house spaces and a daily backstage tour.</p>

            <p><p>The Fort Macquarie Tram Depot was demolished in 1958 and construction started in March 1959. It was built in four stages:</p></p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Stage I (1957-1959) was planning out the building.</li>
                <li>Stage II (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium.</li>
            <li>    Stage III (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells.</li>
        <li> Stage IV (1967–1973) interior design and construction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Opera House was completed in 1973, costing $102 million. H.R. "Sam" was the Hornibrook director in charge of the project. In 1973, he gave the following estimates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.</li>
                <li>Stage II: roof shells will cost M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd about $12.5 million.</li>
                <li>Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.</li>
                <li>Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m.</li>
                <li>Fees and other costs: $16.5m.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 1957, the cost was estimated at £3,500,000 ($7 million) with a completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day). However, it was completed 10 years late and 1,357% over budget.</p>


            <h2>Uluru: </h2>
            <p>Uluru, or Ayers Rock, is a large sandstone in Australia. It is in the southern part of the Northern Territory, near Alice Springs. Uluru is a sacred place to the Aboriginal people of the area, known as the Aṉangu. The area around Uluru is home to many springs, waterholes, rock caves, and ancient paintings. It's also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Uluru and Kata Tjuta, also called the Olgas, are the main attractions of the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. Uluru is a well-known Australian natural landmark and has been a tourist destination since the late 1930s. It's also an important indigenous site. The local people, the Pitjantjatjara, call the landmark Uluṟu. This is a proper noun and the Pitjantjatjara dialect doesn't have any other meaning for it. It's just used as a family name by the Uluru senior traditional owners. On 19 July 1873, surveyor William Gosse saw and named Ayers Rock after South Australia's Chief Secretary, Sir Henry Ayers. Since then, both names have been used. In 1993, a policy was adopted that allowed for both the traditional Aboriginal name and the English name. On 15 December 1993, it was renamed "Ayers Rock / Uluru". It became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory. The order of the dual names, "Uluru / Ayers Rock," was officially reversed on 6 November 2002. This followed a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs. The sandstone formation is 348 m (1,142 ft) high. It rises 863 m (2,831 ft) above sea level. Most of it is underground. Its perimeter is 9.4 km (5.8 mi). Both Uluru and the nearby Kata Tjuta formation are very important to the local Aṉangu people. They lead walking tours to tell visitors about the bush, food, local flora and fauna, and the Aboriginal dreamtime stories of the area. Uluru is special because it seems to change color at different times of the day and year. It's especially red at dawn and sunset. Kata Tjuta is west of Uluru, 25 km (16 mi) away. There are special areas where tourists can go to see Uluru and Kata Tjuta at dawn and dusk. Uluru is mostly arkose, a type of sandstone with a lot of fields.. It also has some conglomerates. The average composition is 50% feldspar, 25-35% quartz, and up to 25% smaller rocks. </p>
            <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/aus2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

            </figure>
            <p>Most of the fields are K-feldspar. The grains are 2-4 mm wide. They're angular to subangular. The finer sandstone is well sorted. The rock fragments include basalt that's been replaced by chlorite and epi-dote. The minerals suggest that the rock came from a granite source. When it's fresh, the rock is gray. But, it turns red-brown when it rusts. Features related to the sediment's deposition include cross-bedding and ripples. This meant it was deposited in broad, shallow, high energy fluvial channels and sheet flooding. Uluru is an inselberg, or "island mountain". It's a knob or hill that rises abruptly and is surrounded by flat land in a hot, dry region. Uluru is also called a monolith, although this term is avoided by geologists. Europeans arrived in Australia's Western Desert in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872. This was possible because of the construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. Ernest Giles and William Gosse were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles saw Kata Tjuta from a location near Kings Canyon and called it Mount Olga. The following year, Gosse saw Uluru and named it Ayers' Rock, after the Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. The first tourists came to Uluru in 1936. Europeans started settling there in the 1940s to help Aboriginal welfare and promote tourism. This increased tourism, so the first roads and tour bus services were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Uluru became a National Park in 1958. The first ranger was Bill Harney. By 1959, the first motel was built and there was an airstrip. In 1963, a chain was added to Uluru to help tourists climb it. The chain was removed in 2019.            </p>

            <h2>Australian War Memorial:</h2>
            <p>The Australian War Memorial pays tribute to armed forces personnel who have died or served in wars involving Australia. The memorial, which opened in 1941, includes a national military museum. The memorial is located in Campbell, a suburb of Australia's capital, Canberra. The Australian War Memorial is at the north end of the city's ceremonial land axis. This line starts at Parliament House on Capitol Hill. Then, it goes through the summit of Mount Ainslie to the northeast. There's no continuous roadway between the two points. But, you can see the War Memorial from the front balcony of Parliament House. And, you can see Parliament House from the front steps of the War Memorial. The Australian War Memorial has three parts: the shrine (Commemorative Area), the museum (galleries), and the records (Research Center). There's also an outdoor Sculpture Garden. It's open every day from 10am to 5pm, except Christmas. Other monuments and memorials on the nearby Anzac Parade are maintained by the National Capital Authority (NCA) and aren't part of the Australian War Memorial. Charles Bean, Australia's official World War I historian, had the idea for a museum memorial to Australian soldiers while observing the 1916 battles in France. The Australian War Records Section was created in May 1917 as an initiative to preserve an accurate and comprehensive record of Australia's involvement in the First World War. Later, records and relics were exhibited in Melbourne and Canberra. A 1927 architecture competition didn't have a winning entry. However, Sydney architects Emil Sodersten and John Crust had to present a joint design. They had a limited budget and the effects of the Depression. The Memorial was supposed to be a museum for Australian involvement in World War I. But, in 1939, the Board of Management realized there'd be another big war. They decided to make the building a space to remember Australia's involvement in all wars. This would include a continuation from World War I. The building was completed in 1941, after World War II started. It was opened following a Remembrance Day ceremony on 11 November 1941 by Lord Gowrie. He was a former soldier whose honors included the Victoria Cross. Since the 1940s, there have been additions to remember Australia's participation in all recent conflicts. The Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier was added in 1993, on the 75th anniversary of the end of World War I, as a memorial to the Australian soldiers who had died in the war.

            <p>The Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier was added in 1993. This was on the 75th anniversary of the end of World War I. It's a memorial to the Australian soldiers who died in the war. The forecourt is the main area in Canberra where Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services are held. Parliament representatives and officials from foreign embassies and Commonwealth high commissions, such as those from New Zealand, attend these services. The Stone of Remembrance is the center of these activities. From the Memorial, the steps towards Anzac Parade lead to the Stone and then the Parade. The forecourt's grass sides act as a natural amphitheater for 35,000-40,000 people. The Memorial provides some seating for Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. The Memorial is a two-story building that looks like a Byzantine cross. It has strong Art Deco elements throughout. In 2001, we added ANZAC Hall to the north. To preserve the view of the original building from Anzac Parade, we designed Anzac Hall to be recessed in the ground and hidden behind a wall. The top level is mostly for World War I (the west wing) and World War II (the east wing). The World War I gallery is set up in the order that Australia was involved in the war. The first two sections are all about the Gallipoli campaign. The gallery was redone in 2014 for the 100th anniversary of the war. It reopened in November 2014. Between the wings is Aircraft Hall. It has a bunch of complete aircraft from different times. mostly from World War II. There's also a restored Japanese A6M Zero airplane. The Memorial has a collection of items. Only 5 percent are displayed at a time. The rest are stored at the Treloar Resource Center. This center is sometimes open to the public. The Memorial's first musical artist-in-residence was Christopher Latham. In 2015, he started the Flowers of War series to remember First World War musicians and artists. Gallipoli Symphony premiered in 2015 and Diggers' Requiem in 2018. The Memorial commissioned Latham's Vietnam Requiem, which was performed for the first time in June 2021. There are plans to commemorate the Korean War (2023), the Holocaust (2024), and World War II (2025).</p>

            <h2>Queen Victoria Building:</h2>
            <p>The Queen Victoria Building (QVB) is a late-nineteenth-century building designed by the architect George McRae. It's located at 429-481 George Street in the Sydney central business district. The Romanesque Revival building was constructed between 1893 and 1898. It's 30 meters wide by 190 meters long. The Ritchie Brothers built the domes. The company also made trains, trams, and farm equipment. The building is a city block on George, Market, York, and Druitt Streets. It was originally designed as a marketplace, but was used for other purposes over the years. It underwent remodeling and suffered decay until it was restored and returned to its original use in the late twentieth century. The property is owned by the City of Sydney and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010. The City of Sydney has been in control of the site since 1842. That's when Sydney Town was incorporated. The site was used for municipal markets before then. The first market was just a "simple storehouse". But later, Governor Macquarie had the idea to make it into a "grand civic square". In the 1830s, "four substantial stone halls" were built. Ambrose Hallen was the designer. Later, the site was selected to be the construction site for "a marvellous centre of trade". In 1897, the council resolved to "dedicate the new market buildings", then still under construction, to Queen Victoria and to name them The Queen Victoria Market Buildings in commemoration of their Diamond Jubilee:

                "To celebrate her Majesty the Queen's fruitful reign, which has brought many blessings to the British people all over the world, we are hosting a special event."
                
                The councilors decided not to ask for the Queen's assent. One reason was that it would have made it "necessary to have the Royal Coat of Arms on the building".Markets originally held in the building were relocated in 1910. The name was amended in 1918 to "Queen Victoria Buildings". In 1987, the council rescinded the 1918 resolution and named it the "Queen Victoria Building".</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The Phippard Brothers built the building from 1893-1898. They were "the leading building contractors of Sydney". Their quarries at Bowral and Waverley supplied the trachyte and sandstone respectively. The building opened on Thursday 21 July 1898. It was a place for businesses like tailors, mercers, hairdressers, florists, and coffee shops. There were also showrooms and a concert hall. In the evening, there was a grand ball for more than a thousand guests in the adjacent Town Hall. The then Lord Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, gave a speech. He talked about how the building was a good investment for the future. The Lady Mayoress used a gold key to open the Druitt Street entrance. On the key was a model of the main dome and the smaller cupolas. It was made by Fairfax and Roberts and presented by the Phippard Brothers. The building was illuminated by about 1,000 Welsbach incandescent burners. This is equal to the lighting power of about 70,000 candles. People said it produced "floods of light" that even in the basement were judged to be "perfect". A public lending library was planned in 1899. The City of Sydney Library and Electricity Department both used to be here. Mei Quong Tart's tearoom, Elite Hall, was opened by the Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, in 1898. The tea rooms were on the ground floor near the center of the markets, in front of George Street. A staircase with plush carpets led to the function hall on the first floor. The Elite Hall could fit nearly 500 people. It had a stage with an elaborately carved proscenium. At the other end was the Elite Dining Saloon. The Queen Victoria Building was listed as a historic site on 5 March 2010. It's an amazing example of Victorian-Federation style architecture. There's nothing else like it in Australia.

              <h2>Bondi Beach:</h2>
              <p>Bondi Beach is a popular beach in Sydney, Australia. It's located 4 miles from Sydney's central business district. 11,656 people live there. Bondi, North Bondi, and Bondi Junction are nearby. A lot of tourists visit Bondi Beach. "Bondi" is derived from the Aboriginal word "Boondi," meaning "surf" or "waves." Europeans first recorded it in 1899-1903. They defined it as "noise made by sea waves breaking on the beach." In 1809, William Roberts got a land grant in the area. Edward Smith Hall and Francis O'Brien bought 200 acres of land with a beach in 1851. They named it "The Bondi Estate." Hall was O'Brien's father-in-law. Over time, O'Brien bought more land and renamed it the "O'Brien Estate."He let people use the beach and land for picnics and fun. As the beach became increasingly popular, the Municipal Council decided to make it a public reserve in 1882. The first tramway to the beach was established in 1884. In 1903, the Waverley Council built the first surf bathing sheds on the beach. On 6 February 1938, five people drowned and over 250 had to be rescued after large waves hit the beach. This day became known as "Black Sunday." Bondi Beach was a working class suburb throughout most of the twentieth century. After World War II, Bondi Beach became home for Jewish migrants from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Germany. The 1990s and early 2000s saw the suburbs grow as people of different cultures moved there. It changed from a working-class area to an upper/middle-class area. Bondi Beach was long a center for efforts to fight indecency in beach attire. This started in 1907 with the Sydney bathing costume protests. The Local Government Act, Ordinance No. 52 (1935) governed swimming costume decency until 1961. </p>

            <p>This caused public controversy as the two-piece "bikini" became popular after World War II. Waverley Council's beach inspectors were responsible for enforcing the law. By the 1980s, topless bathing had become common at Bondi Beach. In 2007, Waverley Council evicted Peter James Paul Millhouse. He had been living on a cliff overlooking the beach. Millhouse, who call themselves Jimmy "Two Hats" Mhi-yles, came to the beach during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and became a local celebrity for their lifestyle and poetry recitals to visitors. In 2009, they were arrested and charged with the rape of a tourist. While they were in custody, Waverley Council removed their belongings from the cliff. In September 2011, charges against Jhyimy were dropped. Waverley Council hasn't compensated them for losing their home or belongings. In March 2020, the NSW Government closed Bondi Beach because too many people were gathered there. This was done to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
