              <h1 class="mb-5">How to Become a Successful Business-person in 3 Steps | Attain a Rich Lifestyle</h1>
              
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>ost people in this world especially the new generation are thinking about getting rich and successful at a very young age, which is not bad, it is a good goal to go for. However, 90% of the entrepreneurs fail because they think that doing business, running a team, or establishing a whole setup that brings you a passive income is just a normal life thing. Here I am going to tell you the mistakes done by most people who fail in business.</p>
              
              
              <p>To make you understand clearly I am going to give you an example of three friends sitting near a swimming pool. There is a part of the pool with shallow water where it is easy for beginners to start swimming. Moreover, the second part of the pool has deep water where only expert swimmers can swim. One of the three friends is thinking, "How much difficult swimming is. I cannot do this even I give it my full effort". With this thought, He never tried to swim. Like this, many people with great abilities never try to come into the business field because they are not sure about themselves even if they can handle this or not.</p>
              <p>The second one is thinking, "How easy it is to swim like we just have to move over hands and legs around". After thinking this, he stood and jumped directly into the deep water. When he jumped, he started to drown. People came and saved him. After that, he became so scared that he never tried to swim even in shallow water. Now, how it is related to business or success? Most entrepreneurs do the same mistake. They do not know anything about business or its fundamentals but still, they think that it is just selling and purchasing. With this thought, they jump into a Business startup, invest their whole savings, and return with failure and disappointment. Now there is a high chance, which usually happens that the failed person will never return to business.</p>
              
              <p>Now, there remains the last friend. He had a very different kind of approach. He wanted to swim and become an expert in swimming. He directly went to the coach and asked to teach him. After the training of several years, he became a swimmer and was able to swim into deep water. He swim until he became an expert with no one like him in swimming. This person is now holding the key to success.</p>
              <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
              <p>
                  <p><h3>1. Way of Thinking</h3></p>
                  <p>If we notice the thinking of the third person, it was very different from the first two, which made him successful. Therefore, the first factor of your success is the way you think. It is a very important thing that how you think and behave during good or bad times. There are times when the business is not going well and you think to shut it down. The best way to think at this time is to renew your old strategies and the way of doing business. Your main aim at that time should be on how to improve my business so it can stand on its own.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                  <p><h3>2. Learn and Practice</h3></p>
                  <p>If you think that anything is easy without learning or practicing it, you will tackle failure in the future. So keep in mind that learning is a very important factor. First, you have to learn and then do the practice. Without learning, do not jump directly into the region where already big players are playing. If you do so no one will ever know that you, at some time existed here. So, to make a stand in between already running big companies, you have to learn How they are doing their work? How do they deal with bad situations? After doing all of the research and learning work, you will jump into the game as an expert who already knows about the rules. You will have far more knowledge than the other beginners in that field.</p>
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                  <p><h3>3. Consistency</h3></p>
                  <p>The Third factor to know about is Consistency. He did not leave swimming because it will take him several years to become a master of it. He remained consistent and gave his best. Just like this, you will have to remain consistent and motivated. At the single point where you lose your consistency, you will begin to back off. Remaining consistent will make you realize, Where you are doing something wrong? No business in this world was established overnight. It can take several months, years, or even decades. If you want to be successful, you have to be consistent.</p>
