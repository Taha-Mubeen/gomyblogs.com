              <h1 class="mb-5">Interesting places to visit in Japan in 2022</h1>

It is known for its beautiful cities, delicious cuisines, rich culture and history, sacred shrines, and much more. One can find a range of amusements to their taste. It is a treasure trove of gems. Here are a few places that we’d definitely recommend visiting!</p>
              <h2>Tokyo:</h2>
              <p>Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is one of the most popular tourist attractions. It is a hub for all forms of entertainment for all age groups.

                <!-- <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>If you’re in Tokyo, then visiting the Tokyo Skytree to get a breathtaking view of the snow-capped Mt.Fuji is a must. The Tokyo Tower is another must-see. Visit the Ryogoku Kokugikan to witness fiery sumo tournaments or visit the Asakasa Palace to relish in the regality.</p>
              <h2>Shibuya, Harajuku and Akihabara; Pop Culture shopping havens:</h2>
              <p>Akihabara is also known as Tokyo’s electronic and nerd paradise. One can find plenty of electronic megastores, maid cafes, video game stores,  more themed cafes, and an array of arcades featuring games you may have long since not heard of. These arcades have crazy photo booths to enjoy with your friends, pachinkos, slot machines, and much more! </p>
              <figure class="my-4">

              </figure>
              <p>Harajuku is a super trendy place where many fashion trends emerged like the gothic Lolita style, gyaru fashion, ganguro fashion, and more. One can often find teen girls and women dressed up in their fancy outfits. The streets act as fashion runways for unique and bold outfits. One must visit Takeshita street, especially on a weekend, to observe the latest fashion trends, try the purikura booths, and more. To unwind from the chaotic scene, one can visit the Meiji Shrine in Yoyogi Park. It was destroyed during WW-|| but was then rebuilt. It was dedicated to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken. The Meiji Jingu Museum is also a must-visit. It was constructed by a famed architect: Kengo Duma. It is a peaceful and sacred place.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/harajuku fashion.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

              </figure>
              <p>Shibuya is another unique and colorful district, lined with an array of amusements. It is packed with fashion stores, nightclubs, and hotels. The Shinjuku Crossing is a crossroads located at the Hachiko Exit of the Shibuya station. It is one of the busiest intersections in the world, seeing thousands of pedestrians pass by every day. It is a great spot for photography as the place is illuminated with an amazing light-up. This place is often seen in movies like Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift or Lost in Translation. The Hachiko statue of the ever-faithful Hachiko dog, whose story is sure to bring tears to your eyes is also nearby. The Meguro-gawa is a river crossing flowing in Tokyo Bay. The enchanting cherry trees over the flowing water provide a picturesque atmosphere.</p>

              </figure>
              <h2>Historic Villages of Shirakawa-go and Gokayama:</h2>
              <p>These quaint villages, located in a mountainous area, are unique to Japan. They were declared UNESCO world heritage sites in 1995. The Gassho-style houses with their thick thatched roofs, resemble hands raised in prayer to the Buddha. The inhabitants of these villages live a very secluded life and their primary source of income includes rearing of silk and cultivation of mulberry trees. These villages are a brilliant example of a traditional way of life that has persevered through years of change and periods of economic upheavals. There are three villages comprised of “Ogimachi” in the Shirakawa-go region, and “Ainokura” along with “Ogimachi” in the Shirakawa-go region. These villages have remained remote and isolated, and even access to them was difficult.  The place has sustained its long history through its beautiful architecture and associated historic environment. To view authenticity, this place is a must-visit.</p>

              </figure>
              <h3>Kyoto: </h3>
              <p>A beautiful place to fully immerse oneself in Japan’s culture. Enjoy the fluttering of cherry blossoms, learn to brew Japanese tea, see graceful Geishas garbed in colorful clothing, and explore centuries-old Shinto shrines. No wonder the city remains a go-to destination for tourists to this day.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">

              </figure>
              <h2>Fushimi Inari Temple:</h2>
              <p>The Fushimi Inari Shrine is an important Shinto shrine located in Southern Kyoto. It is one of the several shrines dedicated to the Shinto god of rice: Inari. Foxes are thought to be Inari’s messengers, which is why you’ll find many fox statues around the shrine as well as many fox-themed items. 
                The shrine’s biggest attraction is the scores of tori gates which create a trail leading into the forest of the sacred Mount Inari. Most travelers visit the shrine to take a hike around the peaceful mountain trails.
                </p>
                <figure class="my-4">
                    <img src="assets/img/fushimi-inari.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <!-- <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
                  </figure>  
              <p>The hiking trail starts with two gates which further lead to rows and rows of gates called Senbon Torii (“thousands of tori gates”). One can also donate a gate starting from 400,000 yen for the smallest sized gate and then increase further in price and size. The donator’s name and date are inscribed on each date. Along the way, one can find many smaller shrines and restaurants with dishes named after foxes like the “Kitsune Udon (Fox Udon).  However, the shrine buildings are just as attractive. The entrance is guarded by the Romon Gate, donated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589. One can then pay respect to the deity by making an offering.</p>

              </figure>
              <h2>Gion- Home of the Geishas:</h2>
              <p>Surely one knows of the graceful and colorfully dressed geishas. Contrary to western belief, Geishas are not prostitutes but rather entertainers. They hold in themselves, the ancient Japanese culture. They are trained from an early age in traditional Japanese art, dance music, etc. They perform at tea houses (ochaya) usually only for locals. Arranging for Geisha dinners is quite costly, whereas hiring one for an evening can cost about $900 or more. A less costly option would be to see their performances at the Gion Corner theatre for$28 or at the Miyako Odori dance festival held during April which cost around $35 or more. You may even some strolling around in the neighborhood, but refrain from photographing them without their permission.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/Geishas.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <!-- <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>One can also view Kabuki shows at the Minazima Theatre. Kabuki means the art of song and dance and is on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. They tell the story of notable historical events and myths, through an outlandish theatrical performance with bold makeup and colors.
                Other than that one can visit the historic tea houses, and restaurants serving local and international cuisines and buy the best souvenirs. Tourists usually visit Hanami-Koji Street for this purpose.
              </p>
              <h2>Monkey Park in Iwatayama:</h2>
              <p>One can find dozen of naughty snow monkeys (Japanese Macaques) in their natural habitat in Iwatayama. One can hike to the top of Mount Arashiyama and see the great view of the city as well as of the mischievous monkeys as they display their amazing agility and acrobatics. One can buy food for them to eat at the park as well. </p>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/Monkey-Park-Iwatayama-Family.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <!-- <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <p>The park also educated the visitors about the monkeys, their habitats, and more. The price for this place is around 550 yen. A delightful place to visit as you get to hike up the mountain and see some unique monkeys as well. Two birds with one stone!</p>
              <h3>Hiroshima:</h3>
              <p>Surely we’ve heard of Hiroshima in our history classes. The tragedy that occurred in 1945, during the Second World War, when a monstrous atomic bomb was dropped on the city, completely decimating all lifeforms and destroying infrastructure. The radiations emitted, affect the residents of the area to this day.
                However, Hiroshima did not let this tragedy bring it down. It recuperated from the great loss and soon found its footing again. Many historical monuments were rebuilt like the Hiroshima Castle and Shukkeien Garden. One can find many remembrance spots scattered around the city. It is also home to two world heritage sites: Itsukushima Shrine and the  Hiroshima Peace Memorial Hall.
              </p>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/hiroshima castle.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <!-- <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
              </figure>
              <h2>Itsukushima shrine:</h2>
              <p>The Itsukushima shrine looks mysterious as it seems to be floating above water with its tori gate. The scenery and ambiance around the place make it one of the top three scenic spots in Japan. The shrine is built upon a sacred island called the Miyajima/Itsukushima island. It is also called the “	Aki no Miyajima. It houses three deities namely: Ichikishimahime-no-Mikoto, Tagorihime-no-Mikoto, and Tagitsuhime-no-Mikoto  It cost around 300 yen for adults and 100 yen for children.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">

              </figure>
              <h2>Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park:</h2>
              <p>The park is over 120,000 square meters and is surrounded by greenery. It used to be the heart of the city before the bombing. The area was then dedicated to peace memorial activities and was not redeveloped.
                One of the main attractions is the Peace Memorial Museum consisting of two buildings, and the museum explores the after-effects of the bombing and all the suffering and chaos that ensued. The details are a quite disturbing and further call to remind us of how disparaging war is. It also gives information about the history of Hiroshima. Nevertheless, it is a good place for history lovers.
                </p>
                <figure class="my-4">
                    <img src="assets/img/A-Bomb-Dome-Hiroshima--1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    <!-- <figcaption>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Explicabo, odit? </figcaption> -->
                </figure>  
                <p>The Hiroshima Peace Memorial also known as the A-bomb dome and or the Genbaku Dome is the only remaining structure left of the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall after the disastrous atomic bomb. The building reminds us of the destructive force of the bomb and the cruelty of mankind, but at the same time, it is a powerful symbol of hope and peace.
                    Between the Museum and the Genbaku Dome, one can find the tombs of the deceased. There lies a register holding their names which are over 220,000. The admission fee is 200 yen.
                    </p>
                <h2>Hiroshima Castle:</h2>
                <p>Hiroshima Castle also known as the Carp Castle, served as an economic center for the city. It was built by a feudal lord named Mori Terumoto in 1589. The castle used to be surrounded by three moats, of which only one survives. Much of the castle was rebuilt with the same architectural style as the original using the same methods, although one may find many contemporary techniques applied in the interior of the castle. There exist three special trees that survived the bomb, that not even this castle could: a holly, eucalyptus, and willow tree. They serve as the city's strength and show its resilience. Visitors can enter the building, and view the many informational exhibits.</p>
