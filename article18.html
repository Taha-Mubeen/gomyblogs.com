              <h1 class="mb-5">Tallest Building in the World | Burj Khalifa</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he Burj Khalifa, formerly known as the Burj Dubai before its 2010 inauguration, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) (just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna but including a 244 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the world's tallest structure and building since its completion in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101 the previous holder of that status. The construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete, with some structural steel sourced from the former East German parliament, the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin. As part of the Downtown Dubai development, the structure was completed in 2010. It was envisioned as the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The government's desire to diversify from an oil-based economy and gain international recognition for Dubai drove the decision to construct the building. The structure is named after Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The structure broke numerous height records, including the title of the world's tallest building.</p>
              
              <p>The Burj Khalifa was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the same firm that designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, the previous tallest building in the world. NORR Group Consultants International Limited oversaw the project's architecture, with Hyder Consulting serving as the project's supervising engineer. The design is inspired by regional Islamic architecture, such as the Great Mosque of Samarra. The tripartite Y-shaped floor geometry is intended to maximize residential and hotel space. The building's height is supported by a buttressed central core and wings. Although the design was inspired by Tower Palace III, the central core of the Burj Khalifa houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also has a cladding system that is designed to withstand the hot summer temperatures in Dubai. It has 57 elevators and 8 elevators in total. At some point during the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers ran into financial difficulties and needed more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, provided financial assistance and funding, prompting the name change to "Burj Khalifa." The concept of profit derived from high-density developments and malls built around the landmark has proven to be successful. The project's surrounding malls, hotels, and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue, while the Burj Khalifa itself has made little or no profit.</p>
              <p>Construction began in January 2004, and the structure's exterior was completed on October 1, 2009. The building, which is part of the 2 km2 (490-acre) Downtown Dubai development at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district, officially opened on January 4, 2010. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill of Chicago designed and built the tower, with Adrian Smith as chief architect and Bill Baker as a chief structural engineer. Samsung C&T of South Korea was the primary contractor, along with Arabtec of Lebanon and BESIX of Belgium. The Burj Khalifa was aimed to be the central focus of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 housing skyscrapers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build the Burj Khalifa was reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify the economy away from oil and toward service and tourism. According to officials, projects like the Burj Khalifa were required to be built to gain more international recognition and thus investment. "He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something sensational," said Jacqui Josephson, Nakheel Properties' tourism and VIP delegations executive.   Until its official opening in January 2010, the tower was known as Burj Dubai ("Dubai Tower"). It was renamed in honor of Abu Dhabi's ruler, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of the UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of dollars to help it pay its debts – Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects.   Dubai began diversifying its economy in the 2000s, but it was hit by an economic downturn from 2007 to 2010, forcing large-scale projects already under construction to be abandoned.</p>

              <h2>
                Architecture and design:
                </h2>
                <p>Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM) designed the tower, as well as the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City. The bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan, is used in the Burj Khalifa. Because of its tubular system, it used half the amount of steel in its construction as the Empire State Building. Khan's contributions to tall-building design have had a significant impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to identify any global practices in tall building design that has not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work. The design is similar to Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Lake Point Tower in Chicago. When Adrian Smith was at SOM, he looked out his office window at Lake Point Tower's curved three-wing layout and thought, "There's the prototype." Strabala claims that the Burj Khalifa was inspired by the 73-story Tower Palace Three, an all-residential building in Seoul. Burj Khalifa was originally intended to be entirely residential. 
                    Following the original design by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Emaar Properties selected Hyder Consulting as the supervising engineer and NORR Group Consultants International Ltd to oversee the project's architecture.  Hyder was chosen for their structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) engineering expertise. The role of Hyder Consulting was to supervise construction, certify the architect's design, and act as the engineer and architect of record to UAE authorities.   NORR's role included on-site supervision during the construction and design of a 6-story addition to the office annex building for architectural documentation. NORR was also in charge of the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel, which was built into the Tower. Emaar Properties also decided to hire GHD, an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to serve as an independent concrete and steelwork confirmation and testing authority.
                    The style is inspired by Islamic architecture. There are 27 setbacks in a spiral pattern as the tower rises from the flat desert base, decreasing the cross-section of the tower as it rises and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in such a way that vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices is minimized. The central core emerges at the top and is sculpted to form a finishing spire. The tower sways 1.5 meters at its tallest point (4.9 ft.). The Burj Khalifa's spire is made up of over 4,000 tons (4,400 short tons; 3,900 long tons) of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs 350 tons (390 short tons; 340 long tons) and stands 200 meters tall (660 ft.). The spire also serves as a communications hub. Because very little of this 244-meter spire is usable, it is widely regarded as vanity height. Burj Khalifa would be 585 meters tall without the minaret. According to a study conducted by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the empty spire "could be a skyscraper on its own." If built-in Europe, this skyscraper would be the 11th highest building on the continent.
                    More than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminum and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins make up the cladding system, which covers 142,000 m2 (1,528,000 sq. ft.). For the harsh desert heat, high desert temperatures, and strong winds, the architectural glass provides solar and thermal efficiency as well as an anti-glare barrier. The glass covers an area of around 174,000 m2 (1,870,000 sq. ft.). [requires citation] The standard curtain wall panels for the Burj measure 4'6" wide by 10'8" high and weigh around 800 pounds each, with wider panels towards the building's corners and taller panels near the top. The outside temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than at the bottom. 15 of the lowest 39 floors are occupied by a 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four Armani hotels. The hotel was planned to open on March 18, 2010, however it didn't till April 27, 2010, after multiple delays. The corporate suites and offices were planned to open in March, but in April 2010, the hotel and observation deck were the only elements of the structure that were open.
                    </p>
                    <p>Swimming pools can be found in the sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th levels.  There are 900 private residential flats on floors 20 through 108. (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). On the 76th story of the skyscraper, there is an outdoor zero-entry swimming pool. Except for the 122nd, 123rd, and 124th floors, which house the At.mosphere restaurant, sky lobby, and indoor and outdoor observation decks, the remaining floors are mostly filled with corporate offices and suites. Burj Khalifa was set to welcome its first occupants in February 2010 according to plans announced in January 2010. There are 57 elevators and 8 escalators in the building. The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 persons per cabin, with double-deck elevators reaching speeds of up to 10 m/s (33 ft/s). The world's fastest single-deck elevator, however, is Taipei 101, which travels at 16.83 m/s (55.2 ft./s). The world's first triple-deck elevators were contemplated, however, the final design called for double-deck elevators. Visitors will find entertainment attractions such as LCDs in the double-deck elevators as they journey to the observation deck. From the first floor to the 160th floor, the building has 2,909 stairs.</p>

                    <h2>Features:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <h3>The Dubai Fountain:</h3>
                        <li>WET Enterprises created a fountain system outside the Burj Khalifa for Dh 800 million (US$217 million). It is 270 m (900 ft.) long and shoots water 150 m (500 ft.) into the air while accompanied by a range of classical to modern Arabic and other music. It is illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 colored projectors. It is the largest choreographed fountain in the world. Emaar announced on October 26, 2008, that the Dubai Fountain would be named after the winner of a naming contest.</li>
                        <h3>Observation Deck:</h3>
                        <li>On the 124th floor, At the Top, an outdoor observation deck opened on January 5, 2010. When it first opened, it was the world's highest outdoor observation deck, standing at 452 meters (1,483 feet).   Although Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower in Guangzhou at 488 m (1,601 ft.) surpassed it in December 2011, Burj Khalifa opened the 148th-floor SKY level at 555 m (1,821 ft.), once again making it the world's highest observation deck on 15 October 2014, until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 m. The electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct of Montréal, is located on the 124th-floor observation deck and allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time as well as view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of the day or in different weather conditions. To alleviate the daily rush of tourists, management allows visitors to purchase tickets in advance for a specified date and time at a 75 percent discount off the price of tickets purchased on the spot.
                            After power outages led an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes, the observation deck was closed to the public for two months on February 8, 2010. When the tide is low and visibility is good, people can see Iran's shores (about 153 km or 95 mi away) from the top of the skyscraper.
                        </li>
                        <h3>Burj Khalifa Park:</h3>
                            <li>The Burj Khalifa is surrounded by a 27-acre park designed by landscape architects SWA Group. The park, like the tower, was inspired by the flower of the desert plant Hymenocallis. The water room, which consists of pools and water jet fountains, is located in the center of the park. Images of the Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower appear on benches and signs.
                                Water collected from the building's cooling system is used to water the plants. Annually, the system produces 68,000,000 L (18,000,000 US gal). The park's six water features were designed by WET Enterprises, the same company that created the Dubai Fountain.
                            </li>
                        <h3>Ramadan Observance:</h3>
                        <li>The sun can still be seen on higher floors for several minutes after it has set at ground level. As a result, Dubai clerics have decreed that those living above the 80th floor must wait 2 minutes longer to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor must wait 3 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Records:</h2>
