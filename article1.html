              </figure>
              <p>One cannot simply come to Loire Valley, and not visit the many luxurious chateaux, rich in history. The most magnificent and highly visited chateaux is no doubt “The Château de Chambord.” The chateaux exhibits the imposing architectural features of the French Renaissance. The ingenious double helix staircase, said to have been designed by Leonardo Da Vinci is sure to boggle your mind. The immaculate gardens and serene lake provides a beautiful scenery and adds to the charm. Not to mention you can ride carriages and feel like a royal yourself! The artistic tapestries documenting history, the 800 carved salamander sigils and the very spectacular interior will surely leave you breathless.</p>
              <p>Factors to consider when planning your trip are the time of the year and the exchange rate of Euro. Expect high prices in summer as it is peak travel season. For better prices, visit off-season. There are plenty of hotels available in Loire Valley with prices starting $100 per night. It is best to keep a budget of €700 to spend on exploration and other activities.</p>
              <!-- Le Mont-Saint-Michel -->
              <h2 class="mb-5">3. Le Mont-Saint-Michel:</h2>
              <p>A tidal island in Normandy, France, visited by more than three million visitors each year. Its rich history and legend can be keenly felt as you traverse the outstanding place. The abbey is an architectural masterpiece, of Romanesque and Gothic style, and is divided into two main parts: the abbatial church and the Merveille. When the tide is out, one can take a leisurely walk along the rippled sand (under the supervision of a guide). The rising tides here are the highest in all of Europe and often makes the island inaccessible during a high tide. So visit this location while the tides are in your favour! The heart and soul of Mont-Saint Michael lies in its abbey, perched at the highest point of the rocky islet. It is sacred place of worship, visited by pilgrims for centuries. With over 20 rooms to visit, it is a monument to visit for the old and young. Walk around the impressive fortifications, surrounding the historic town, and stroll around the ramparts for an excellent view of the bay. The perfect opportunity to not only tour a historic site but also take awesome photographs. The bay of Mont Saint Michael is worth exploring as it houses a whole ecosystem of its own. Take a quiet saunter along the shore and enjoy the scenic coastline. Visit La Grande Rue, to go back to the medieval times as the buildings here date back to the 15th century. Moreover, you can shop from the many souvenir stores and also have a bite at the restaurants.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>If you’re a seafood lover and especially love oysters, then stop by Cancale, a fishing port in Brittany. Not only that, Mont St Michael is close to many cities and wonderful sights. The walled city of Saint-Malo I but an hour drive from the place. To get the most out of your visit, pair up a trip to the Mont St Michael with another one of these treasures.</p>
              <p>With more than three million visitors per year, expect a crowd. Visitor numbers are lowest from December to March. Admission costs for the Abbaye du Mont Saint Michel is €11 for adults, €8 for 18-25 year olds and free for those under 18. (The ticket is free for EU citizens or permanent residents).

Average hotel price for a couple is €111 per night.</p>
              <!-- Dordogne region -->
              <h2 class="mb-5">4. Dordogne region:</h2>
              <p>The Dordogne regions offers a number of attractions. It is also called the “Valley of a Thousand Chateaux.” It is 45% forest which is why cycling and mountain biking are a must when visiting this area.

The Chapelle Notre Dame houses the Black Madonna carved from a walnut tree, which has been drawing in worshippers and pilgrims in search of miracles. Go canoeing from Saint-Suzy to Pinsac, rowing past the Château de Belcastel, Château de la Treyne and Château de Lanzac. (Hitting two birds with one stone!) Enjoy the crystal clear water, and the majestic castles as you canoe. Be sure to take a delicious picnic with you on the excellent trip. Tighten your shoe laces for a visit to La Grotte De Domme! Look at awe-inspiring stalagmites and stalactites in this magnificent cave system. Take a look at this natural underground gem located in the heart of Domme.</p>

              <h2 class="mb-5">5. Pink Granite coast:</h2>
              <p>Visit one of France’s most beautiful coastlines, “The Pink Granite Coast”! It is named after the unique pink granite that emerges from the moor by the coast. The gorgeous contrast between the rosy rocks and the turquoise sea is worth seeing. Only three coastlines in the world have this natural geological curiosity.

Therefore, a low-cost budget is ideal for such a place.</p>
              <!-- Strasbourg -->
              <h2 class="mb-5">6. Strasbourg:</h2>
              <p>Strasbourg, a cultural bridge between France and Germany, is a riveting visit. One can experience the best of French and German cuisine, along with the best of booze. A visit to the Gothic style cathedral and the Petite France neighborhood (aUNESCOworld heritage site) is a spell binding experience. The cathedral houses the astronomical clock, a complex automate, and the “Pillar of Angels” representing the Last Judgement. The “Petite France neighbourhood” is famous for its timbre buildings, canals and river locks which exude a strong German vibe. Petite France is a pretty and tranquil place to stroll around. Tanners, millers and fishermen used to live and work here in the past, back when it was quite the dark district because of the stench of skins and furs. Not anymore! Now it is one of the most visited areas with quaint cobblestone alleys, half-timbered houses, narrow streets and boutiques. Maison des Tanneurs, the former headquarters of the city’s Tanners Guild is now a restaurant! The Cathedral Notre Dame is a magnificent sight to behold quotes by many poets for its beauty. Intricate mural paintings, beautiful stained glass windows and the old organ, are sights to see. One can also get a panoramic view of the city by climbing above. The Astronomical clock features different stages of life, above which are the apostles who walk before Christ. Be sure to see the clock go off at 12:30 to see a surprise!</p>
              <figure class="my-4">

              </figure>
              <p>Strasbourg is the perfect place for the history geeks!

It is recommended to rent a bicycle rather than a car, which can cost around €140. Whereas a car rental can cost from €200-500, with a not-so-pleasant experience.</p>
              <!-- Marqueyssac Gardens -->
              <h2 class="mb-5">7. Marqueyssac Gardens:</h2>
              <p>One of the finest achievements in the history of French gardens is Marqueyssac's suspended gardens. The Marqueyssac gardens, located between La Roque-Gageac and Beynac on a rocky spur overlooking the Dordogne Valley, span 22 hectares. The chateau is crowned by a roof composed of 'lauze' (limestone slabs) typical of Perigord that weighs more than 5 million tons and was built with great simplicity. The beautiful bastion terrace is composed of multiple box trees that have been meticulously maintained by the estate's four gardening professionals, with cypress trees adding structure to the landscape. The box trees are carefully carved in curves to reflect the roundness of the surrounding hills, and getting lost in this green labyrinth may be quite fun. After passing through the bastion terrace, you have three options for walking through the Holm oak forests, all of which lead to the belvedere. On the way to the belvedere, box trees are allowed to grow more freely, and several side pathways allow walkers to switch from one track to another. The Cathedral Notre Dame is a magnificent sight to behold quotes by many poets for its beauty. Intricate mural paintings, beautiful stained glass windows and the old organ, are sights to see. One can also get a panoramic view of the city by climbing above. The Astronomical clock features different stages of life, above which are the apostles who walk before Christ. Be sure to see the clock go off at 12:30 to see a surprise!</p>
              <figure class="my-4">

              </figure>
              <p>The A20 and A89 auto-routes connect Paris, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, making the Dordogne Valley easily accessible by vehicle (French for motorways). If you're coming from Australia or the United States, you could fly to Paris Charles de Gaulle, then take the TGV from the airport station straight to Bordeaux, where you can rent a car. Visitors may walk about the gardens without needing a guide because of the graphic signs and panels that provide information on the park's history as well as the wildlife and flora. Between April and September, it is also possible to follow a guide at no additional expense. A boutique and a "salon de the" (open from Easter until the end of October) are also located on the property, both of which offer superb views of Beynac Castle.</p>
              <p>The gardens are open 24 hours a day. The gardens are only open in the afternoons in the winter, and from February to November, they are open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at a least, and longer in the mid- and high-season. Adults pay 9 euros, while children aged 10 to 17 pay 4.50 euros. Every Thursday evening in June, July, and August, the garden is open for evening visits. The walks are lit by 2000 candles, while pianists, saxophone quartets, jazz groups, and other performers animate various areas of the garden. If you visit during the summer, it is a magical experience not to be missed. Adults pay 14.50 euros for a night time admission, while children aged 10 to 17 pay only 7 euros.</p>
              <!-- Giverny -->
              <h2 class="mb-5">8. Giverny:</h2>
              <p>If you love flowers and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Paris, take a train to Giverny, the home of French impressionist painter Claude Monet's gardens. A day excursion from Paris is the ideal way to see Giverny. Art lovers go to the village of Giverny, which is located about 70 kilometres northwest of Paris, to marvel at the gardens depicted in Impressionist artist Claude Monet's paintings. While the Claude Monet Foundation is undoubtedly a must-see, the lovely village and its surroundings have far more to offer. All tours include visits to Claude Monet's home (Maison et Jardins de Claude Monet), a pastel-pink mansion flanked by flower-filled gardens and a famous Japanese bridge, as well as the Museum of Impressionisms (Musee des Impressionnismes), which is dedicated to various forms of impressionist painting. Other excursions combine a visit to Giverny and Monet's house with a visit to the Palace of Versailles or Auvers-sur-Oise, Vincent van Gogh's final home. Garden bike tours are another active travel option. A Giverny tour is great for art lovers, especially those interested in impressionism. The ride to Giverny, which takes you down the Seine River and through Normandy's sunflower fields, is almost as enjoyable as the destination. Because there are no ATMs or currency exchange offices in the village, bring plenty of cash. Although lodging is available, due to the village's tiny size, availability is limited; if you plan on staying overnight, book ahead of time.</p>
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/giverny.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

              </figure>
              <p>It is best to arrange your journey by rail. Booking a tour to this place not only involves travelling through heavy traffic and on uneventful toll highways, but it's also not a place where you want to be on someone else's schedule or crammed into a group with tourists. The best alternative is to take the train from St Lazare station to Vernon-Giverny, which runs multiple times a day. It takes about 45 minutes and costs as little as 9 EUR for a single ticket. Shuttle buses to Giverny run every 15 minutes from Vernon station and cost only 10 EUR roundtrip. You should budget roughly €100 ($115) each day for your Giverny trip, which is the average daily price based on other guests' spending.

              <h2 class="mb-5">9. Verdon Gorge:</h2>
              <p>One of Europe's most magnificent river valleys is the Verdon Gorge. Its name is derived from the remarkable turquoise color of the Verdon River, which flows through its magnificent 25-kilometer (15.5-mile) length in Provence, southern France. The Verdon Gorge ('Gorges du Verdon' in French) is a popular destination for hikers and rock climbers alike, reaching a depth of 700 meters (2296 feet) at some locations. The Styx du Verdon, a gorge sub-canyon, and the 'Imbut,' a funnel that appears to vanish into the rock, are both fascinating features of the Verdon Gorge. The gorge is a popular destination for kayaking and trekking because of its proximity to the French Riviera. Climbers also flock to the area because of the variety, quantity (over 1,500), and difficulty of the routes accessible. During the Triassic period, the entire region was under water (around 250 million years ago). The sea floor, sea shells, and corals built up and were compressed over millions of years to form limestone rock. Plate motions forced the sea floor to rise over time, forming the mountains when it emerged from the sea. Glaciers formed during the ice age, and as they migrated and melted, the soft limestone was eroded away, leaving the Verdon Gorge's valleys, rivers, and rock formations. The Gorge may be reached by road from both the north and south. Because of its proximity to the French Riviera, it is now a well-known tourist attraction. Kayaking, hiking, picnicking, and other activities make it a worthwhile addition to a trip to France.</p>

              <p>There are a number of well-known hiking trails:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Martel sentier (pathway) was named after the adventurer Édouard-Alfred Martel. He and a group were the first to finish a gorge trip.</li>
                    <li>The Imbut Trail is a trail that runs through the town of Imbut.</li>
                    <li>Rancoumas' Belvédère by the Tusset Bridge (the Rancoumas panoramic viewpoint near the Tusset Bridge).</li>
                </ul>
                Summer is the greatest time to visit, from June through August. The weather will be sunny all day, and the boat rentals will be available. Go during the shoulder season to avoid the crowds (May or September). Just keep in mind that the rentals may be unavailable. Entry of Verdon Gorge is free. The best time to visit Verdon Gorge is between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
