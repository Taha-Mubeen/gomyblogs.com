              <h2>Gerald’s Game:</h2>
              <p>Gerald’s Game is a 2017 psychological thriller film based on Stephen King’s novel of the same name which was long thought to be unfilmable.</p>
              <p> In an attempt to save their tattered marriage and rekindle the affection in their relationship, a couple (starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood) leaves on a remote retreat. With all hindrances out of the way, they engage in a harmless kinky game with handcuffs and plenty of imagination but are instead faced with an unforeseen accident that leaves the wife Jessie handcuffed to the bed frame. She must then engage in a harrowing fight for survival with her demons and the ones lurking in the shadows of her desolate house.</p>
              <p>The film very aptly captures the eeriness of isolation and certainly makes you feel the tension and fear as well. The director very beautifully weaves the scenes together to create this masterpiece of a movie.</p>

              <h2>I am Mother:</h2>
              <p>I am Mother is a 2017 Australian science fiction thriller directed by Grant Sputore, with a screenplay by Michael Lloyd and a story written by them both.</p>
              <p> In an attempt to save their tattered marriage and rekindle the affection in their rThe film takes place in a future where humanity has gone extinct. In a quiet facility, there exists an AI, charged with the responsibility of repopulating the Earth with the help of sixty-three thousand embryos. The android soon extracts an embryo and the film then follows the child’s growth and development. The robot teaches the daughter everything from science to ethics and the fact that the outside world is uninhabitable due to high contamination levels. However, their peaceful life is soon disturbed by an unexpected intruder leaving the daughter to question all that she’s known.</p>
              <p> “I am Mother” is a wonderful amalgam of science and philosophy. It explores the various facets of humanity using minimum characters and maximum storytelling.</p>

              <h2>Nightcrawler:</h2>
              <p>Nightcrawler is a 2014 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Dan Gilroy.</p>
              <p> Petty thief Louis “Lou” Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhal) turned stringer, records violent accident footage in Los Angeles and sells them to a local television news station. As his work gains more traction, Lou’s methods and ethics become increasingly questionable, till the line between observer and participant begins to blur.</p>
              <p> The movie revolves around unethical journalism and the moral vacancy of TV news. Jake Gyllenhall gives his best performance as the antihero Lou, with his slicked hair, and gaunt insomniac aesthetic. His penetrating glare seems to always be recording his surroundings. His side-kick, Rick (played by Riz Ahmed) steals the show with his brilliant performance as the helpless and desperate recruit.  </p>

              <h2>Beasts of No Nation:</h2>
              <p>Beasts of No Nation is a 2015 American war drama film written, co-produced, shot, and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga. It is based on the novel of the same name written by Uzodima Iweala.</p>
              <p>The movie takes place in a fictional West African country where civil war breaks out. A young boy named Agu gets caught up in a skirmish and is then turned into a child soldier for a rising rebel faction. There Agu sees the many horrors of war firsthand and is even forced to partake in many vicious and disturbing crimes.</p>
              <p> “Beats of no Nation” is a compelling and thought-provoking film about the exploitation of children in a situation that seems both abstract and real. It once again presents us with the daunting and monstrous consequences of war. Certainly, this is not a film for the light-hearted as the topics being dealt with are very heavy paired with vivid visuals that paint the whole scenario. </p>

              <h2>Hairspray:</h2>
              <p>Hairspray is a 2007 musical romantic comedy film based on the Broadway musical of the same name, which was in turn based on John Water’s 1988 film of the same name.</p>
              <p>The movie takes place in 1962 and follows Tracy Turnblad, a plump bundle of joy, who wishes to join a program called “The Corny Collins Show” which is a local dance show for teens. The kids on the show are popular and are also on a Council that supervises auditions for the program. However, the show enforces an all-white policy, except for a specific day of the month. Tracy longs to be on the show but her integration ideals and weight get her rejected. The story then follows Tracy as she campaigns for integration.</p>
              <p>The movie is super fun with its cast’s joyous energy and manages to discuss many serious issues amidst the song and dance. The movie gives you no time to be bored and is filled with energy from beginning till end. One can also immerse themselves in the 60s and watch some amazing choreographies and singing.</p>

              <p>Ip Man 3 follows his life in Hong Kong, where a corrupt property developer and his thugs terrorize a school. At the same time, he faces the challenge of another Wing Chun fighter ambitiously looking to take over his Grandmaster title.</p>
              <p>The spinoff is about Cheung Tin Chi, who gets into trouble with a foreigner while keeping a low profile.</p>
              <p>In the finale, Ip Man travels to San Francisco for a personal matter where he finds his disciple in trouble with the local martial arts community by opening a Wing Chun school and teaching it to foreigners. Moreover, it deals with the discrimination against the Chinese.</p>

              <h2>Okja:</h2>
              <p>Bokja is a wild and adventurous Korean film directed and written by Bong Joon-Ho, with a screenplay by Bong and Jon Ronson.</p>
              <p>The film is about a young girl named Mija who lives in a remote village with her giant best friend the Okja: a genetically modified super pig created by the Mirando Corporation as a solution to global hunger. These super pigs will provide more meat to consume while also making minimum impact on the environment. Okja is also highly intelligent and empathetic and even saves Mija once from a life-threatening situation making their bond stronger. However, their wonderful days are soon shattered when a spokesperson for the Mirando arrives and separates the pair, taking Okja to the US to be killed and served as food for all. Mija now sets off on a journey to save her cherished friend.</p>
              <p>The movie gives a clear message on animal rights, factory farming, and the food industrial complex. However, rest assured for it is by no means vegetarian propaganda. The movie is brilliantly crafted and the digitally conjured Oka is sure to steal your hearts with her sincerity and show that she is not a thing but a living soul.</p>

              <h2>The Meyerowitz Stories:</h2>
              <p>The Meyerowitz Stories is a 2017 American comedy-drama film directed and written by Noah Baumbach,</p>
              <p>Three dysfunctional siblings Danny (Adam Sandler), Jean (Elizabeth Marvel), and their half-brother Mathew (Ben Stiller), live under the shadow of their father who leaves no chance to show his disappointment in them. This causes a sense of failure among the siblings which results in random outbursts of rage and rivalry often leading to comedic sequences. </p>
              <p>Baumbach captures each character perfectly from the father’s artistic attitude to the defeated sister who tries her best to merge with the background yet always manages to deliver the most poignant lines.
                One certainly enjoys the ping pong match among the siblings as they go for each other’s throats.
